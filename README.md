# VOSK-Powered-Live-Subtitle-V3
ANDROID APP that can RECOGNIZE ANY LIVE AUDIO/VIDEO STREAMING (powered by VOSK OFFLINE Speech Recognition API) then TRANSLATE it (powered by ONLINE Google Translate API) and display them as SUBTITLES.

This is modified version of my previous app https://github.com/botbahlul/VOSK-Powered-LIVE-SUBTITLE-V2 (on the TRANSLATION METHODE) which on this version I use ONLINE Google Translate API.

In my opinion this translate methode gives a better accuracy with the cost in performance. And also it has more languages support compared to MLKIT Translate API.
